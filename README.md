# shapeless-for-mortals

Workshop material for the Scala eXchange 2015 talk "Shapeless for Mortals".

**There is no need to read or study this material in advance** (in fact, it won't make any sense until you've seen the presentation).

Please check out this repository and type `sbt updateClassifiers` to ensure that you have all the dependencies for the day.

You may also wish to check out the following, as they will be instructive:

- https://github.com/fommil/spray-json-shapeless/

On the day, please ensure that you have the latest version of this repository, as I will surely be making last minute changes.
